      SCENE — Outer Walls and Courtyard of Castle Adamant.  Melissa,
               SachaRissa, and ladies discovered, armed with
               battleaxes.

                                      CHORUS
                              "Death to the Invader!"

      Chorus:           Death to the invader!
                          Strike a deadly blow,
                    As an old Crusader
                          Struck his Paynim foe!
                                Let our martial thunder
                                Fill his soul with wonder,
                                Tear his ranks asunder,
                                      Lay the tyrant low!
                    Death to the invader!
                          Strike a deadly blow,
                    As an old Crusader
                          Struck his Paynim foe!

      Melissa:          Thus our courage, all untarnish'd,
                          We're instructed to display;
                    But to tell the truth unvarnish'd,
                          We are more inclined to say,
                    "Please you, do not hurt us,"

      All:                    "Do not hurt us, if it please you!"

      Melissa:          "Please you let us be."

      All:                    "Let us be — let us be!"

      Melissa:          "Soldiers disconcert us."

      All:                    "Disconcert us, if it please you!"

      Melissa:          "Frighten'd maids are we!"

      All:                    "Maids are we, maids are we!"

      Melissa:          Please you,

      All:                    Do not hurt us;
