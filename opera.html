      SONG <p>(King GAMA with CHORUS of GIRLS)</p>
                                "Whene'er I Spoke"

<h4>Gama:</h4>   <p>Whene'er I poke
                    Sarcastic joke
                          Replete with malice spiteful,
                    This people mild
                    Politely smil'd,
                          And voted me delightful!

                    Now, when a wight
                    Sits up all night
                          Ill-natur'd jokes devising,
                    And all his wiles
                    Are met with smiles
                          It's hard, there's no disguising!

               Ah!  Oh, don't the days seem lank and long
               When all goes right and nothing goes wrong,
               And isn't your life extremely flat
               With nothing whatever to grumble at!</p>

  Chorus:      Oh, isn't your life extremely flat
               With nothing whatever to grumble at!

<h4>Gama:</h4>      <p>When German bands
                          From music stands
                    Play'd Wagner imperfectly —
                          I bade them go—
                          They didn't say no,
                    But off they went directly!
                          The organ boys
                          They stopp'd their noise,
                    With readiness surprising,
                          And grinning herds
                          Of hurdy-gurds
                    Retired apologising!
               Ah! Oh, don't the days seem lank and long
               When all goes right and nothing goes wrong,
               And isn't your life extremely flat
               With nothing whatever to grumble at!</p>

  Chorus:      Oh, isn't your life extremely flat
               With nothing whatever to grumble at!

<h4>Gama:</h4>      <p>I offer'd gold
                          In sums untold
                    To all who'd contradict me—
                          I said I'd pay
                          A pound a day
                    To any one who kick'd me—
                          I've brib'd with toys
                          Great vulgar boys
                    To utter something spiteful,
                          But, bless you, no!
                          They would be so
                    Confoundedly politeful!</p>

               <p>Ah! In short, these aggravating lads,
               They tickle my tastes, they feed my fads,
               They give me this and they give me that,
               And I've nothing whatever to grumble at!</p>

  Chorus:      Oh, isn't your life extremely flat
               With nothing whatever to grumble at!

<p>(Gama Bursts into tears and falls sobbing on a seat.)</p>

<h4>Princess:</h4>    My poor old father!  How he must have suffered!
               Well, well, I yield!

<h4>Gama:</h4>        <p>(Hysterically)</p>  She yields!  I'm saved, I'm saved!
       <p>(Exit)</p>

<h4>Princess:</h4>    Open the gates — admit these warriors,
               Then get you all within the castle walls.
       <p>(Exit)</p>

                <p>(The gates are opened and the Girls mount the
                  battlements as the Soldiers enter.  Arac, Guron and Scynthius
                  also enter.)</p>
