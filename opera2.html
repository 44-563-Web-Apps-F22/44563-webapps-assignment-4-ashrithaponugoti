    Chorus of Soldiers
                           "When anger spreads his wing"

  <p class="Chorus">Chorus:           When anger spread his wing,
                          And all seems dark as night for it,
                          There's nothing but to fight for it,
                    But ere you pitch your ring,
                          Select a pretty site for it,
                          <p class=direction>(This spot is suited quite for it,)</p>
                    And then you gaily sing,
                    And then you gaily sing:

                    "Oh I love the jolly rattle
                    Of an orde-al by battle,
                    There's an end of tittle-tattle
                          When your enemy is dead.
                    It's an arrant molly-coddle
                    Fears a crack upon his noddle
                    And he's only fit to swaddle
                          In a downy feather-bed!</p>

  <h4 class="name">Ladies:</h4>   <p class="Ladies">For a fight's a kind of thing That I love to look-upon,So let us sing,Long live the King,
                     And his son Hi-la-ri-on!</p>
